I will create a web portal that displays a collection of recipes of different categories/cuisine. This portal will include the followings:

- Recipes of different food categories/cuisines.
- "Recommended Recipe" highlights the recipe with the highest 5 star rating.
- "Recipe of the day" highlights the recipe most viewed in the last 24 hours.

The database will include the following entities/relationships:
1. Recipe (id, title, description, prep_time, cook_time, category_id, cuisine_id, author_id, views, photo)
2. Author (id, name, country)
3. Category (id, name)
4. Cuisine (id, name)
5. Ingredient (id, recipe_id, name)
6. Quantity(recipe_id, ingredient_id, quantity, measurement)
7. Cooking Method (recipe_id, description)
8. Note (recipe_id, description)
9. Users (id, name, country)
10. Review (user_id, recipe_id, num_of_stars, review_text)
11. Rate (user_id, author_id, num_of_like, review_text)
